# Python is Object Oriented Language so everything will be implemented in terms of classes and object.
# Oops- (Object Oriented Programming System)-
' 1) Class  2) Object  3) Abstraction  4) Encapsulation  5) Inheritance  6) Polymorphism'

# 1) Class - Class is a blueprint for creating an object, class is logical structure with behavior

# 2) Object - Object is instance of a class.
#             class contain methods, and we can access it by creating the object. Object is a physical entity.

# 3) Abstraction - It hiding implementation details and showing essential details (Ex- ATM Machine).

# 4) Encapsulation - It binding the data and function into single entity.

# 5) Inheritance - Derived class inherits the properties of base class.  (Completely deals with Classes)

' Types of Inheritance - i) Single Inheritance   ii) Multiple Inheritance   iii) Multilevel Inheritance'

# i) Single Inheritance -> Derived class inherit the properties from single base class.
# ii) Multiple Inheritance -> Derived class inherit the properties from more than one base class.
# iii) Multilevel Inheritance -> When the derived class become a base class of another deriver class.

# 6) Polymorphism - Implementing the same method in different way.     (Completely deals with methods)
#    (Ex- + = Arithmatic Addition(integer)
#    (Ex- + = Concatenation (string))
#     In above Ex-   + is a same operator but implementation is different is known as polymorphism.
