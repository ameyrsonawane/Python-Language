# Arithmatic Operators (+ - * /)

'''x = 15
y=7
print(x+y)
print(x*y)
print(x**y) # Exponenciation
print(x//y) # Result will be near to whole number'''


# Assignment Operators

x = 10
print(x)
x += 3
print(x)
x -= 5
print(x)
x *= 5
print(x)
x /= 2
print(x)
x **= 3
print(x)

# Comparison Operators

'''x = 22
y = 11

print(x == y)
print(x != y)
print(x > y)
print(x < y)
print(x >= y)
print(x <= y)'''

# Logical Operators

'''x = 10
y = 4
print(x == y and x > y  # both condition should be satisfied
print(x == y or x > y)  # any one condition should be satisfied'''

# Membership Operators

'''x =["Amey","Sonawane"]
y =["Amey","Sonawane"]

print("Amey" in y)
print("Amey" not in y)'''


'''x = 19
y = 3
z = x + y
print(z)
z = x * y
print(z)
z = z + 5
print(z)
z = z + 3
print(-z)'''

# Operator Precedence

'''print(5 + 8 - 4) # Follow BOD MOS Rule
print(5 +(8-4))
print(4 ** 2 + 4 - 2)'''


# Boolean Datatype (True and False)

'''x = 5
y = 7
z = "" # (Empty String)
print(x == y)
print(x < y)
print(bool(z)) # bool function allows us to evaluate any of the values and return boolean datatype (True/False)'''
